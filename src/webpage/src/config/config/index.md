# Configuration

In order to serve a directory you need to create a configuration file the directory you want to server.
Without an existing configuration file Jarklin refuses to start.
This was made to ensure you serve the correct directory.

The filename is either `.jarklin.yaml` or `.jarklin/config.yaml`.

See [available options](config-options.md) or [an example configuration](config-yaml.md).

::: tip
Use the [wizard](../../guide/wizard/index.md#config-generation) to create your config.
The wizard should be more than enough for the average user.
Only if you need more specialisation or optimization you should look here.
