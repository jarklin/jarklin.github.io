# Setup

In order to serve a directory you need to create a configuration file.
Without an existing configuration file Jarklin refuses to start.
This was made to ensure you serve the correct directory.

The file is either `.jarklin.yaml` or `.jarklin/config.yaml`.

> `.yaml` is the recommended file-format but `.json` or `.jsonc`
> is also supported in case you are more familiar with that format or prefer it for different reasons.

Go to the next page to see the options you can configure.
