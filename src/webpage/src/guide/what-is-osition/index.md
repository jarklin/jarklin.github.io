# What is Osition

Similar to [jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), Osition is a Free Software Media System used to organize, manage and share your digital media files to other network devices.
The differences are that Osition is less bloated and instead of searching the internet to identify your videos, Osition generates all information from the files itself.
This ensures your privacy and yields better results for personal videos like from Holidays.
