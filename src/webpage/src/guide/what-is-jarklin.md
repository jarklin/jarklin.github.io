# What is Jarklin?

Similar to [jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), Jarklin is a Free Software Media System used to organize, manage and share your digital media files to other network devices.
The differences are that Jarklin is less bloated and instead of searching the internet to identify your videos, Jarklin generates all information from the files itself.
This ensures your privacy and yields better results for personal videos like from Holidays.
